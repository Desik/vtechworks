Registering for VTechWorks allows you to be notified when new articles are added to 
particular communities (for instance, new scholarship from the Virginia Tech 
Transportation Institute). 

You will NOT be able to add items to VTechWorks until a repository 
administrator has given you permission to contribute to a community. See 
http://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu for a list of communities, then email
vtechworks@vt.edu with the name of the community you would like to contribute to. 

Thanks!

The VTechWorks Team
